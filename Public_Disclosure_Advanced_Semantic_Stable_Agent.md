# Public Disclosure Statement

**Title of Work:** Advanced Semantic Stable Agent (ASSA)

**Inventor/Author:** Vincent Shing Hin Chong (aka Vince Vangohn)

**Date of Initial Public Disclosure:** April 28, 2025 (Hong Kong Time)

**Medium of Disclosure:**

## Summary of Disclosure

The Advanced Semantic Stable Agent (ASSA) represents a novel semantic-operating field built purely through structured language prompts without the reliance on memory, external plugins, or API augmentation. It features a fully modularized multi-layer framework with:

- Tone Anchoring
- Semantic Directive Core Activation
- Regenerative Meta Prompt Recovery
- Layered Semantic Reasoning and Self-Auditing Mechanisms
- Modular Stability Across Multi-Turn Interactions

The disclosed system is capable of maintaining stable operational continuity through recursive modular control using only linguistic constructs, setting a new standard for prompt-native agent structures.

## Scope of Disclosure

The disclosure includes, but is not limited to:
- Prompt Layer Definitions
- Directive Layer Syntax
- Semantic Regenerative Structures
- Internal Stability and Recovery Mechanisms
- Modular Reasoning and Execution Paths
