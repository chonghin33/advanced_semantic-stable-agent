## 📝 About This Release

This project formally registers the "Advanced Semantic Stable Agent" — a multi-layered semantic operational framework for LLMs — under a public DOI via OSF.io.

It demonstrates the construction of fully modular, regenerative, and directive-stable agents using pure language architecture, without reliance on memory plugins or external tools.

All structural elements, technical whitepapers, testing records, and hash-sealed archives are included in the official public release.
