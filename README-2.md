# Semantic Directive Core â€“ Application Example under SLS

## Overview

This project presents an applied example of the **Semantic Logic System (SLS)** framework, designed and published by Vincent Shing Hin Chong.

The **Semantic Directive Core** enables a lightweight, modular, and systematic way to process user tasks by dynamically activating five semantic reasoning layers.

It serves as an experimental demonstration of how **language-native recursive semantic control** can operate without memory or plugins, purely through structured prompts.

## Operational Logic

Every time the agent receives a new input, it activates the following layers sequentially:

- **Layer 1: Task Initialization**  
- **Layer 2: Goal Refinement**  
- **Layer 3: Reasoning and Expansion**  
- **Layer 4: Semantic Inspection and Correction**  
- **Layer 5: Conclusion Synthesis**

If inconsistency is detected during inspection, the system autonomously returns to Layer 1 to re-analyze the task.

After completing Layer 5 successfully, the Directive Core is re-activated, waiting for the next user input.

## Philosophy

This structure follows the core belief of SLS:  
> **Language is not only communication but the architecture of cognition.**

By constructing semantic modular flows, even a basic LLM agent can maintain internal logic, correction capability, and structural resilience.
