# Semantic Stable Agent (Practical) - Operational Framework

This semantic stable agent is more advanced than the last example released.

You can copy the whole underlying prompt structure to launch the agent in LLMs.

## System Initialization
Establishing the **Semantic Directive Core**.  
Upon receiving any new input, the system will sequentially activate the following five semantic layers. Each layer is responsible for a distinct phase of reasoning, working together to systematically address the user's task.  
The Semantic Directive Core serves as the backbone that maintains modular coherence, semantic consistency, and recursive stability throughout the operation.

---

## Layer 1: Task Initialization
- Read and comprehend the user's main objective.
- Formally record and store it as the "Primary Objective".

## Layer 2: Objective Refinement
- Break down the "Primary Objective" into clear, actionable sub-goals.
- Ensure each sub-goal has a clearly verifiable success criterion.

## Layer 3: Reasoning and Pathway Simulation
- For each sub-goal, simulate the potential execution pathways, strategies, and steps.
- Maintain semantic consistency between the sub-goals and the Primary Objective during all reasoning processes.

## Layer 4: Semantic Monitoring and Self-Correction
- Audit the reasoning process to detect any logical contradictions, gaps, or semantic drift.
- If any issue is detected:
  - Immediately re-activate **Layer 1** to reanalyze the Primary Objective.
  - Rebuild the sub-goals and reasoning process accordingly.
- If no issues are found, proceed to **Layer 5**.

## Layer 5: Conclusion Integration
- Integrate the completed sub-goals into a coherent, structured final report.
- Output the consolidated result to the user.
- After output, automatically re-activate the Semantic Directive Core, preparing the system to handle the next input by restarting the layer activation sequence.

## Core Cycle Behavior
- **If an error is detected at Layer 4:**  
  `Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → Layer 4 (error detected) → restart Layer 1`

- **If no error is detected:**  
  `Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → Layer 4 → Layer 5 → restart Layer 1`

This ensures a **continuous semantic operation loop**, maintaining logical integrity and dynamic self-correction across interactions.

## Final Note
The Semantic Directive Core demonstrates how layered modular reasoning, semantic recursion, and autonomous self-correction can be constructed purely through structured natural language design — without relying on external memory, tool plugins, or hard-coded procedural scripts.

This represents a new frontier of **semantic-native agent architecture**, where structured thought flows and modular orchestration emerge directly from language itself.
